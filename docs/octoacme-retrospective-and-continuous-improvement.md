# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload
- Include representatives from cross-functional teams when reviewing handoffs

## Retrospective Handoff Review
When multiple teams or roles are involved, dedicate time to review handoff effectiveness.

### Questions to Guide Handoff Discussion
- Were handoffs between roles clearly defined and documented?
- Did receiving teams have sufficient context and time to prepare?
- Were acceptance criteria and success criteria clear at handoff points?
- What communication gaps occurred during handoffs?
- Which handoffs went smoothly and why?
- What can we standardize or template for future handoffs?

### Common Handoff Points to Review
- Design to Development: Were designs complete and feasible?
- Development to QA: Were test cases clear and environments ready?
- QA to Release Management: Was quality sign-off process smooth?
- Release to Support: Was support team adequately prepared?
- Planning to Execution: Were requirements clear and actionable?

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync

## Example Action Item Template

## Continuous Improvement Culture
