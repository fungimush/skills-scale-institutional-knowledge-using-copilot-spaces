# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

This folder contains OctoAcme's project management process documents. This README provides a brief overview of our approach and links to the detailed process docs.

## Quick overview of OctoAcme processes

OctoAcme uses an iterative, customer-focused approach to deliver product value. Key elements:

- Roles & ownership: Each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead (PdM). Developers, QA, and stakeholders play defined roles with clear responsibilities.
- Lifecycle stages: Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Close & Retrospective.
- Iterative delivery: Work is broken into small, testable increments with acceptance criteria and a Definition of Done.
- Communication cadence: Daily standups (team), weekly PM/PdM sync, demos at the end of sprints or milestones, and monthly stakeholder updates.
- Risk & dependency management: Maintain a Risk Register, review risks weekly, and follow escalation paths for blockers and incidents.
- Quality & releases: CI, automated tests, security scanning, smoke tests, rollback plans, and release notes for deployments.
- Continuous improvement: Run retrospectives after sprints/releases/incidents and track actionable items in the backlog.

These processes are designed to improve alignment, reduce risk, and make onboarding and contribution easier for new and existing team members.
